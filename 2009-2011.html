				Salt Lake County Film and Media Center, A Media Art House for the 21st Century, University of Utah, School of Architecture and Planning

				Utah is known for its exemplary contributions to the art of film. Sundance Film Festival is world renewed and provides an avenue for films of all shapes and sizes to be shown and judged. With my design for the new Salt Lake City Film Center, I wanted show a modern ever changing perspective. The SLC “The power of film lies in its ability not only to support a community but also to build community by bringing people together. With more than a million residents, Salt Lake County has a growing and diverse population whose demands for artistic and cultural programming are evolving and changing." The film center would offer programming that not only entertains but also educates. Independent, international and documentary films will inform the masses as an "anchor for economic and urban revitalization."<br>
				The conceptual theater would be located in a rather drab part of Salt Lake City, lacking in infrastructure and modernization. The lot where the cinema would be located on is baron and lifeless. Yet inspiration was found in the unforgiving environment, a piece of weathered newspaper gave way to a shining structure. Technology helped in the transformation, and my imagination did the rest. The newspaper was used to create a parti diagram and the process allowed me to experiment with the form and spatial relationships. How the overlapping of spaces can create interlacing flow and direction through the theater. The curves of the paper and flowing edges gave way to the basic structural integrity. Thee creases and folds of unique geometry could be manipulated and simplified to an architectural representation my Salt Lake City Film Center.<br><br>

				“The competition is to create a temporary installation to occupy the site adjacent to the historic Capitol Theater in downtown Salt Lake City. The idea is to provide visitors with an outdoor recreational/leisure area and a much-needed refuge in an urban environment.”<br>
				My proposal is an evolving structure based off a mushroom. In nature a mushroom reaches, expanding further and further into space until it can no longer sustain its reach. Then the fungus begins to die and decay, soon it has degraded so much that there is no longer a footprint, no longer proof of its existence. This fungal organism is sustainability, thus defining my urban organism. The concept began to fabricate itself though the expansion and contraction of an urban context. <br>
				A pre-fabricated structure built of scrap acrylic sheets and 3form, with a concrete base for support will be woven together to make the organism. Quick connections and fabricated pieces will make for easy construction and subtraction; a fabricated system machined with a CNC and donated material will limit the amount of scrap and make for efficient construction.
				The urban environment is ever changing like a fungus, its spreads quickly but cannot sustain and must retract or perish. This design a short 18 month representation of the evolving space between spaces, an empty lot gives life to community. Though small, the manifestation of community is extremely important.The filling of the space between spaces with a culturally rich environment and strong social fabrication is a way to cultivate community.<br><br>

				The LA Cultural Center project was developed by the professors at the University of Utah. It was the occasion to create a unique gathering place in the city. Its main purpose was to be a cultural facility conveyed in an urban space, providing the public with information on cultural events, exhibitions, and the arts. Within the design process I decided to take the sounds from the site and transform them into a structure. <br>
				I sat for hours with my eyes closed detailing the sounds, finding rhythms, and creating a vision. My thoughts wondered my hand begins to write "Voices are rare in occurrence but when heard they have power over me. I break away from concentration, and then focus on the voice, eyes forever closed. The voice interjects; I hear his breathing, his footsteps, his dragging. Profound is the world without vision, only sound." <br>
				When the time came to create the structure, the sound helped build the walls and foundation. The cultural center developed into a formidable design, transcending sound, creating sight. <br><br>
