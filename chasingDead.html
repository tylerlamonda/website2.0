          Chasing Dead is a story-based, Sci-fi First-Person Action Shooter. The game begins with a strange phenomenon in which another Earth appears in our skies. The curiosity and fear of a doppelganger planet initiates multiple missions in order to make contact with the duplicate Earth. A team of agents, astronauts, and scientists were sent 955,600 miles across space by NASA and the US Military, however all contact is lost a few hours after their arrival. You play as a marine named "Jake" who is sent on a mission to retrieve any research and data left behind by the original survey team while fighting off hostile forces.

 JAKE IS A 29 YEAR-OLD MERCENARY WHO IS A FORMER DEA AGENT AND SOLDIER WHO IS HIRED BY US GOVERNMENT. 
 During his training he was a identified as a lone wolf. He was recruited not just for his combat skills but for his self-driven tenacity and and ability to make sound decisions on his own without the need for guidance. After his recruitment, he underwent a cybernetic operation that protects him from infection by the creatures of the parallel Earth. Jake suddenly wakes up in a crashing plane with no memory of his mission or any of events that happened after his arrival. To assist him on his mission, he is regularly contacted by an agent named Christine who monitors his actions and advises him as he progresses. While carrying out his mission, Jake steadily tries to heal from his amnesia as he searches for the truth of the parallel Earth's horrendous apocalypse.
