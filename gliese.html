        A snapshot of this squid like crstacean was taken below 5,000ft. It was discovered during an expendition of the seabed in search of mineral deposits on Gliese 581. Little is known about this creature at this time.

        Living on an earth like planet, Gliese 581, where life has evolved to a hexapedal genome base. A large ocean based creature that can lay its eggs both on land and in the     water. Gliese 581is much larger than Earth with longer seasons. Migration demands multiple times of laying eggs either on sandy beaches or in shallow kelp fields. Six extremities have    become critical to its survival helping the creature glide through the water and move seamlessly on land. The creature can breathe air or water and is a herbivore. They are very   social creatures, living in large family groups.

        Six extremities have become critical to its survival helping the creature glide through the water and move seamlessly on land. The creature can breathe air or water and is a herbivore. They are very social creatures, living in large family groups. Another reason that migration is so important, they eat up food sources quickly having to move on in search of their next meal.

        <img src="assets/images/subpage/Creatures/P006_Process2.png" class="img-responsive center-block"><br>
        S.M.P. enhabits the tropical and forested regions of Gliese 581. Originally my wife had a nightmare that she was trying to find her way out of an abandoned apartment complex and was 'being chased by these menacing slugs'. Everything they slid over dissolved away from the acid in their slime, as long as a football with eyes on top of the body, a mouth in the front middle section, and hundreds of feelers on both sides.

        When creating the slug I immediately thought of where it would have come from, a lush wooded forest that has plenty of rain. I wanted to capture an image of the slug as if discovering it for the first time, before it was harnessed as a weapon to hunt people down...haha.
